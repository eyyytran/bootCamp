# Day 2 Notes

## Functions

- Structure
  - name
    - def functionName
  - argument
    - ():
  - body

## Dictionary/ Object

- variable = {
  'key':'value',
  'key':'value',
  'key':'value',}
  - The value doesn't have to be a string. It can be a string, int, bool, float, list
  - You can have an infinite number of key:value pairs
- Accessing a value in the dictionary
  - You must reference the key that it is associated with

```
print(variable['key'])
print(variable['keyforalist'][index])
print(variable['keyforalist'][index]['keyfordictionaryinthelist][index])
```

## Loops

- They can iterate over lists, dictionaries, and call something a bajillion times
- use ctrl-c to terminate the loop

### While

- These loops run while the condition is still true.

```
while 'condition':
  return 'something'
  something that'll make it stop, like i += 1
```

- the condition can be checked many times
- break statement
- continue statement

### For

- An emoji is a string character code
- You will probably want to use this for LISTS

```
d = [list]
for y in d:
  print(y)
```
