# Functions and Their Usage

Functions are things we create to do steps we often repeat.

## Referencing vs Invoking

` print(function)` - This is referencing a function.

- This will print the memory address.

`print(function())` - This is invoking a function.

`variable = function`

- This is assigning the memory address to the variable.

`print(variable())`

- This will print the result of the function.

```
def function(n):
    return funtion(n-1)
```

- This is an example of recursion.
